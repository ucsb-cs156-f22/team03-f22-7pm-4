# Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] The main branch is deployed on Heroku at, for example,
      <https://f22-5pm-1-team02.herokuapp.com>
- [ ] All assigned methods of all six controllers for the new database tables
      are operating correctly on Heroku
- [ ] There is full test coverage and mutation coverage for all of the controllers
- [ ] The team has taken care of all of the Kanban board updates and Pull Requests
- [ ] The link to the repo and the link to the Heroku app are submitted on 
      Canvas on behalf of the team, as clickable links.  Note that there is no need for -docs or -docs-qa repo links
      since this assignment is backend only, and for now
      we are only producing frontend documentation in those
      repos.
